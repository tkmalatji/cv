  <h1>Thomas' Journey in HTML</h1>
  <!--This is known as indentation, where it is easy
      to read the code by making it as a child to the body tag <body>
        leaving a space so that body tag is a parent tag

        NB! If you dont want to do this manually you can go to
        packages, atom beautify, it will do this for you automatically for you.
        This makes it convenient
      </body> -->
      <p>I am an aspiring <em>web developer</em> willing to go through the ranks
      of learning basic HTML, CSS, and <strong>Javascript</strong></p>
      <!--Just created my first paragraph in HTML!!! and italicized aswel  -->
      <p>
        Writing a paragraph is really easy, learning to write basic HTML builds
        confidence in proceeding onto greater <br /> and in depth concepts of web
        development.  Do not despise the humble beginnings, treasure the journey
        of learning.
      <p>
        Therefore, persue this journey and never let go of it, seek to get a
        mentor to assist you on this journey of discovery!
      </p>
